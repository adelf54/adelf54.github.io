		<p>Welcome to A Fan's Guide to Baseball. This page is your ultimate guide to the best of baseball culture. On this website, I will be giving my insight on the best baseball stadiums in <a href="https://mlb.com">Major League Baseball</a> , highlighting the unique food of certain stadiums and the historic jerseys of certain teams. Additonally, I will give some insight into the cities where some stadiums are located while giving information on local culture and attractions to explore if given the change to attend. Whether you are a die-hard baseball fan or just curious about the sport, A Fan's Guide to Baseball is the place to go to learn everything you need to know about some of the best baseball staidums I have attended. While I have only attended games at a fraction of all of the MLB stadiums, a dream of mine is to explore them all. As my experiences grow with each new stadium attended, I hope to update A Fan's Guide to Baseball to keep you all updated as well.  </p>
